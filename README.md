# Kevin's Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation for building this webpage was to learn the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript, in order to someday become a full-stack web developer.
I build this project to make the next step in my career.
This page shows that I can use these new skills to build a basic webpage.
I learned that building webpages is fascinating and fun!

## Usage

This Prework Study Guide can be used to get up to "dip a toe" into the most basic languages used in web development. It lists topics we've learned from prework and chooses one topic for us to study first. Opening the "DevTools" console in Google Chrome is a great way to see your code in action, with updates in real-time.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
